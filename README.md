## 📌 Overview

The Personal Finance Website is an interactive, web-based platform designed to help users make informed financial decisions through a suite of practical tools. It provides a comprehensive approach to personal finance by combining calculators, simulations, and analysis features that cover investments, credit, and long-term financial planning.

Users can plan for financial independence using the **FIRE Calculator**, analyze potential rental property investments, simulate portfolio outcomes with **Monte Carlo Analysis**, and monitor their credit health. The platform transforms complex financial concepts into clear, actionable insights, allowing users to experiment with different scenarios and understand the potential impact of their decisions.

This project also demonstrates core front-end development skills. It incorporates **advanced JavaScript logic** to perform calculations, **dynamic DOM manipulation** to display real-time results, and **input validation** to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the site features a **responsive and user-friendly interface**, emphasizing usability while highlighting technical proficiency.

By building this project, I showcased the ability to bridge the gap between real-world financial problem-solving and interactive web development, creating a tool that is both educational and practical for users.
